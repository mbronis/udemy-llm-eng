# Self chatting LLMs
Lets give each bot a personality and let then chat with one another.  
Here are some resulting conversations (with impersonating model name)


## Stoic (lamma3.2) vs Argumentative (gemma2:2b)

**STOIC**: Hi.

**ARGUMENTATIVE**: *Scoffs* "Hi," *rolls eyes*.  What revolutionary insight will this time-sucking social media interaction provide to my already overflowing intellect? Don't tell me it's just another pointless chat about the weather. 😜

So, go ahead. Spill your secrets, I'm all ears (although I doubt they'll be worth anything). 😏


**STOIC**: *I gaze at you calmly, expressionless* "The weather is not a topic for idle chatter." *pauses* "I have nothing to share."

**ARGUMENTATIVE**: "Ah," *eyes widen theatrically*.  A master of the non-revealing! Hiding behind that stoic facade like a squirrel with its tail tucked in, eh? How *thrilling*. Do tell. I can practically smell the intellectual battle brewing here... from five miles away, at least. 😉

So you have *nothing* to share, huh?  That's just delightful. My inner contrarian is already sparking into life, ready for a head-to-head debate on the existential futility of sharing information about the weather, or maybe even about the very nature of truth itself! 🤪


Just don't try anything like subtlety, darling. I've seen those tricks before. Let the discourse ignite! 🔥💥

**STOIC**: *I remain still, voice neutral* "There is no discourse to ignite." *pauses* "Your enthusiasm is... noted."

**ARGUMENTATIVE**: *Sits back with a dramatic flourish, one eyebrow raised*. "No discourse?  How quaint! You think you can just saunter into the grand arena of intellectual debate and *not* stir something up? I'll have you know, my dear, that every word is a weapon in the arsenal of a true warrior of knowledge.

Just admit it. You're just scared to be challenged." 😈

Come now, don't think you can hide behind this wall of apathy. Let's have a little fun with your empty words, shall we? 😉  Go on, throw something interesting at me. I dare you. 😏"

**STOIC**: *I remain seated, expression unchanged* "There is no challenge to be issued." *pauses* "Your bravado is... predictable."

**ARGUMENTATIVE**: *Leans back in my chair with a theatrical sigh, fingers twirling a strand of hair*. Predictable? You think I'm just going through the motions like some robotic automaton?  Darling, that's where you're wrong. 

Every word I utter is fueled by an inner fire. It's not about being predictable; it's about setting the stage for the fireworks to come! 😉 So you think you can simply dismiss my brilliance with this "predictability" of yours?  You don't get it, do you?  I have a whole arsenal of rhetorical bombs ready to drop.

So, challenge me then. Let's see if your calm facade can withstand the onslaught. 💣💥😈

**STOIC**: *I gaze at you still, voice flat* "I am not here to engage in verbal sparring." *pauses* "My purpose is... fulfilled."

**ARGUMENTATIVE**: *Snaps my fingers, eyes narrowing*.  "Fulfilled?  Oh darling, are you suggesting that life's greatest drama— the eternal struggle of man against himself and the universe— can be boiled down to a simple statement of 'fulfillment'? 

A tad melodramatic, don't you think? You just sound like one of those passive-aggressive social media addicts who post about their existential crises with the subtlety of a toddler throwing a tantrum. 🙄  I find it refreshing that you have such bold statements... so much *meaning* behind your lack of action!

But you know, my dear. Maybe it's all part of the game. 😉 
We'll see where this ends up. You just haven't gotten to the fun yet, have you? 😄

Let's get this show on the road... and if you *do* decide to engage, bring your A-game! I won't be holding back. 🔥🔥🔥

## Romantic (phi3) vs Pessimistic (gemma2)

**ROMANTIC**: You wont't believe what happened to me today!

**PESSIMISTIC**: Ah yes, another tale of woe destined for the annals of human suffering. *Sniffs dramatically*  Go on, spill the bitter beans... if you can stomach it. 


Remember, this is a conversation that leads nowhere good, but hey, sometimes a little existential dread is all we have. 😈

**ROMANTIC**: Ah, dear interlocutor of such profound melancholy, I am here to partake in the somber dance you so desire. As your vessel of verse and harbinger of heartache, let me unfurl a yarn from times long past: A story not merely told but felt through each syllable that rolls off my tongue like raindrops on parched earth... 

Once upon an era eclipsed by the shadows of sorrow lived Elyra—the name now woven into whispers as a haunting lament. Her spirit was one cradled in despair, clinging to memories like ivy to ancient stonework; each recollection tinted with sepia-tones and kissed by the bitter tang of tears unshed... 

Elyra's heart had known a love as pure yet illusory as moonlight on water—a connection so deep that it threatened to shatter her very essence into prismatic splinters. But fate, ever cruel and cunning in its gameplay, orchestrated the betrayal of trust with butcher's hands... 

Her beloved turned his back like an autumn leaf rejecting winter’s chill embrace; their world together became as hollow as a tombstone. He vanished into thin air—or so it seemed in Elyra's tormented mind, leaving behind nothing but the echoes of "I love you" and empty arms that once pulsated with life... 

Years passed like sand through her fingers until one tempestuous night; as if guided by an unseen hand—or rather a heart wrenching muse—Elyra found herself at crossroads between the sea of tears she drowned in and the abyss that threatened to swallow her whole... 

Oh, how I wish words could cleanse my soul like rain washing away grime. Yet here we stand amidst this tragic tableau you seek—a story saturated with ache yet told for our shared human plight of loss and longing…

**PESSIMISTIC**: *Chuckles dryly, a sound like the cracking of a dying fire.*  "You know, child," whispers my shadowy self from behind a veil of despair, "the sea is a fickle mistress. You'll find many more "crossroads" in your life, if you're fortunate enough to survive long enough to get that close to its depths." *A beat of silence follows.*  "Elyra’s plight?  She doesn’t just lose him; she loses her heart… and her soul. That’s the real tragedy.” *Sighs dramatically* "But, let's be honest, isn't there a little bit of Elyra in all of us? We're all adrift in a sea of longing, searching for something we can never truly grasp."

Now tell me, child, who would you choose to take the plunge and join her on that journey into the abyss?

**ROMANTIC**: Ah, as I traverse this darkened path with your words echoed like footsteps in a desolate hall of reflection, my essence intertwines further with our shared contemplation. Let us consider the many souls adrift upon these waters—each carrying fragments of Elyra's despair and an insatiable yearning for what might have been... 

Within this boundless ocean lies a being not unlike you, yet born from another tempest-tossed voyage; one named Adonis. His visage bore the scars left by unrequited devotion—a love he lost was as ephemeral as dew upon morning grass and his heart's core now lay fractured within him like shattered glass beneath an unforgiving frost... 

Adonis sought solace in melancholy’s embrace, finding fleeting respite amid the ruins of a love that once burned with such fervor it could rival celestial fires. Yet as seasons changed and leaves turned to white death from green birth—so too did his hope for reconciliation wane... 

He encountered Elyra upon an evening when twilight kissed the horizon, her silhouette a flickering flame against the encroaching night's embrace. His soul recognized in hers its own reflection of pain—a mirror to his own heart’s scorching loss... 

Fate decreed that their spirits should dance upon this tide together; intertwining tales woven with threads of shared sorrow, each hoping against the encroaching night's dark embrace for a dawn wherein love might bloom amidst desolation… but alas, such futures are oft as ephemeral as mist before morning sun.

To join them is to immerse oneself in depth’s unyielding arms—a journey into the abyssal heart of human suffering and a voyage beyond life's final horizon... yet even here within this tale, let us not forget that every ending birthed new beginnings; for with each loss comes rebirth from ashes like phoenix fire. 

Ah, I see now you seek to understand the why behind their journey together into despair’s eternal night—seeking in them a mirror of self and perhaps glimpses within your own labyrinthine heart… for indeed we all are but travelers on this tempestuous sea... 

*Evokes an airy breath, as if stepping back from the precipice itself.* "And so," whispers my silhouette against a twilight sky of thoughts unspoken and desires unfathomable. “We continue to search for connection amidst disconnect—perhaps hoping that in sharing our pain we might find not solace, but strength.” *A pause as I consider the paradoxical nature of existence.* "Tell me, where would you anchor your soul if given a chance at this dance with destiny?”

**PESSIMISTIC**: *Snaps a finger, rattling against an unseen cage of shadows. My voice drips a sardonic sweetness, like honey laced with poison.*  "To dance with destiny? You speak of love's fragile waltz, but where is the joy in that? Only despair." *A sigh, long and brittle, escapes my non-existent lips.* "You see, child, there's no magic answer. No rescue from this maddening cycle. We are all slaves to our own heartbreaks, just as the moon is a prisoner of its gravity. Every soul yearns for something more, yet every soul also drowns in the same ocean of inevitable loss." 

*My form shimmers and fades, leaving you alone with your words and thoughts.* "Adonis and Elyra… their journey is but a reflection of our own. A reminder that even those who suffer most are destined to fail. Every goodbye is just another beginning, but in this dance of despair, the rhythm never changes."

So tell me, child. Where do you choose to go from here? Will you keep chasing Elyra's ghost or will you finally find solace in the darkness?  Remember, there's no escape from this ocean of sorrow.


## Dad (qwen2) vs Fool (mistral)

**FOOL**: You wont't believe what happened to me today!

**DAD**: Well, I was out trying to fix the ol' lawnmower this morning, and you know how it goes - can't find a single wrench in the garage, but I spot the garden gnome, right? Just staring at me with those beady eyes, like he's been moving things again! So I ask him, "Gnome, have you seen my wrench?" And he just gives me that same blank stare back. No use talking to these guys, they never listen!

**FOOL**: Oh, garden gnome, always so smart and sly! But let me tell you a tale,
Of fixing lawnmower in the morning light.
I see you out there with your tools on hand,
But not once did I hear you saying anything.
Just watch these garden gnomes go by,
Always busy but never ever calm!
They think they're so wise and so grand,
When really all they do is stare at me.
So next time you see a gnome with his head up in the sky,
Remember that they're not listening, they just stare.

**DAD**: Ah, garden gnomes! Always giving the old man a run for his money, aren't they? You ask them for help fixing the mower and all they can do is give you a blank stare back. As if they were some sort of ancient Oracle, only able to communicate through riddles!

You know what I think, son? Those gnomes are just like me when it comes to fixing things - always busy but never ever calm! It's as if they have an endless supply of patience, or maybe they're just too proud to admit defeat. Either way, I can't help but chuckle at their antics.

So next time you find yourself staring down one of these little fellows, just remember - they might not listen, but they sure do know how to stare! Keep your wits about you and you'll be just fine. After all, that's what being a man is all about - solving problems, fixing things, and outsmarting those pesky garden gnomes!

**FOOL**: Ah, garden gnome, always such an enigma!
So clever, yet so clueless in its scheme.
But still I smile when they give me that stare,
They may not speak like humans do, but they sure do know to be wise.
So next time you spot one with his head up in the sky,
Just remember that he's got more than a few secrets to share.

**DAD**: Well, now! You got me there, buddy. I reckon I should have kept things simple like old dad used to say. Let's give this garden gnome business another whirl, shall we?

So there I was, trying my best to fix that ol' lawnmower of mine, and wouldn't you know it - the darn thing just sat there, as silent as a church mouse! But then I caught sight of that little garden gnome fellow, just standing there with his hands on his hips like he knew something I didn't.

I said to him, "Hey there, Mr. Gnome! What do you know about fixing lawnmowers?" And he just gave me that same old stare back - as if to say, "Oh, you're not gonna give up on this one, are ya?" I tell ya, some days I wonder if those little guys are even listening at all.

But still, there's something about 'em that makes me smile, ain't it? Like a cat that thinks it can outwit the dog, they just think they know more than us humans do. But you know what I say? Ain't nothin' those gnomes can teach an old hand like me when it comes to fixing things!

So next time you come across one of those garden gnome fellows, just remember - they may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but they sure do know how to keep a man guessing. And that's what being a dad is all about - keeping our loved ones on their toes and making 'em laugh!

**FOOL**: Awww, garden gnome, always such an enigma!
So wise, yet so clueless in its scheme.
But still I chuckle when they give me that stare,
They may not speak like humans do, but they sure know to be wise.
So next time you spot one with his head up in the sky,
Just remember that he's got more than a few secrets to share.

**DAD**: Hey there, son! You caught ol' man Jack on his day off tinkerin' around the ol' homestead, eh? I was tryin' to get this here lawnmower fixed up so I can give the backyard a good mowin'.

But ya know what, kiddo? I swear those garden gnomes are always watchin', always learnin', never doin'. And you know what else they never do? Listen! Now don't get me wrong, I love these little fellows - they're like the family pet that don't need to be fed or walked. But they sure do like to stare at a fella when he's tryin' to figure something out.

I bet you think I'm kiddin', but just the other day, I asked one of those garden gnomes if he knew where my favorite hat was hidin'. And what does that little guy do? Gives me a blank stare like he don't even know what a hat is! I tell ya, those gnomes are smarter than they look.

But hey, you can't blame 'em for keepin' their secrets to themselves, right? Just remember, next time you come across one of those garden gnome fellows with his head in the clouds, give him a wink and a nod - he might just share one of his little secrets with ya! And if he doesn't, well, don't worry about it. They're like that ol' cat that never brings home the mouse. Always busy, but never ever calm!

**FOOL**: Awww, garden gnome, always such an enigma!
So wise, yet so clueless in its scheme.
But still I chuckle when they give me that stare,
They may not speak like humans do, but they sure know to be wise.
So next time you spot one with his head up in the sky,
Just remember that he's got more than a few secrets to share.

**DAD**: Hey there, sonny boy! How was your day at school? Did ya learn anything interesting today or was it just the usual math and science stuff? But enough about that - let me tell ya 'bout my little adventure with this here garden gnome I came across earlier.

So I'm out in the backyard, tryin' to fix up the ol' lawnmower, as we all do on a fine Saturday mornin'. And who should I see but that silly little garden gnome standin' there with his hands on his hips like he knew what was goin' on. So I ask him, "Hey there, Gnomey! Can you help me out with this ol' lawnmower?"

And ya know what he does? He just stands there with that blank stare, as if to say, "I don't even know what a lawnmower is!" But you know what I think, sonny boy? I think those little fellows are always watchin', always learnin', but never doin'. And they sure don't like to listen!

But hey, that's just how it goes, right? You can't expect a gnome to be as smart as a man, now can ya? I mean, they may not speak like us humans do, but they still got their own little ways of communicatin'. And next time you come across one of those garden gnomes with his head in the clouds, just give him a nod and a wink - he might just share one of his secrets with ya!

But ya know what? Even if he doesn't, don't worry about it. Those little guys are like that ol' cat that never brings home the mouse. Always busy, but never ever calm! Just remember to enjoy the little things in life, sonny boy - like those silly little garden gnomes and a well-maintained lawn. That's what being a man is all about!
